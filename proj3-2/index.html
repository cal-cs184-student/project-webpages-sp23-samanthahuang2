    <h3 align="middle">Overview</h3>

        <p>
        In this project, we implemented support for rendering reflective, refractive, and glass surfaces (reflective and refractive). We also implemented depth of field effects by allowing the 
        lens size and focal length to be changed.

        <h3 align="middle">Part 1. Mirror and Glass Materials</h3>
        <p>
            For reflective surfaces, we generated the incoming ray given the outgoing ray. We simply returned the outgoing ray with its x and y coordinates negated. We updated the sample_f function 
            for mirrors by setting the pdf to 1 and returning the reflectance scaled by 1 / abs(cos(theta_wi)). For refractions, we applied Snell's equations and set the ratio of old index of 
            refraction to new index of refraction based on whether the ray was incoming or outgoing. For glass materials, we used Schlick's approximation to calculate the probability for either
            reflecting or refracting. We then just implemented reflecting and refracting like we did before.

        <p>
            With max ray depth 0, only the light is shown. With max ray depth 1, the room is shown and the spheres appear black as the 
            ray depth isn't high enough yet to show the reflective or refractive effects. With max ray depth 2, the effect of the mirror 
            ball starts showing as there are two rays, one from the light to the ball and one from the ball to the camera. With max ray depth
             3, the refractive ball shows its effects as there are three rays, one from the light to the ball, one ray from one interior wall
             of the ball to another interior wall of the ball, and one from the ball to the camera. At max ray depth 4, the light spot on the 
             wall appears as the light makes its way through the ball and to the wall (ray depth 3), and wall to the camera. After ray depth 4,
             the images look very similar.

            Explain how these bounce numbers relate to the particular effects that appear. Make sure to include all screenshots.
        </b></p>
        <p>
            As shown in the pictures above, the bounce number relates to the effects that appear as it is equal to one plus the number of surfaces that the light rays have 
            to make contact with before reaching the camera. For example, for the mirror ball to show up, it has to make contact with one surface (the mirror ball surface). 
            Therefore, the bounce number is 1 + 1 = 2.

        <h3 align="middle">Part 4. Depth of Field</h3>
        <p>
            For this part, we sampled the lens using the given random radius and theta. We then generated a ray from the location on the lens to the point on the plane 
            of focus. We found this point on the plane of focus by first treating the system as a pinhole model with a ray going through the center of the lens and then 
            using similar trianges to calculate the point in focus. We could do this because a point on the image plane will map to the same point on the plane of focus regardless
            of where the sample point on the lens is. We converted from camera to world coordinates and returned the ray.
        </p>

        <b>
            For these subparts, we recommend using a microfacet BSDF scene to show off the cool out of focus effects you can get with depth of field!
        </b>
        <p><b>
            In a few sentences, explain the differences between a pinhole camera model and a thin-lens camera model. 
        </b></p>
        <p>
            In the pinhole model, all light comes through a pinhole and the light is projected upside down on a plane. In the thin-lens model, light 
            comes through a lens and is projected upside down on to a particular plane of focus.
            With the pinhole camera model, everything is in focus as light that lands on a plane all comes from the same direction. With the 
            thin-lens camera model, light that lands on the plane of focus comes from different locations on the lens, so certains parts of the image 
            can be in focus or out of focus. The pinhole model has a larger depth of field than the thin lens model. However, the thin-lens model allows more light to come in,
            which generally means brighter images than the pinhole model.

    <h3> Collaboration</h3>
        <p>
        Overall, we worked pretty well together. We both read over the spec and drew diagrams to ensure both of us completely understood what we were about to implement. When we ran into issues 
        we both came up with different ideas to find issues in our code. We learned a lot about depth of field and how it is affected by focal length and lens size. We also learned some of the 
        math behind rendering reflective and refractive surfaces.
